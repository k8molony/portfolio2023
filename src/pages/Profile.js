            Hi, Iâ€™m Katy. I've always had an interest in technology but never
            thought I could actually code myself until I suddenly found myself
            teaching online. I was a French teacher, and due to the global
            pandemic, I suddenly had to figure out the best way to keep my
            students interested through a screen. Our district used the LMS
            Canvas, which has a lot of simple things to do, but to make it even
            better, it allows you to go into the code. I started playing with
            that, learning some simple HTML, and realized that there were a lot
            of similarities between learning that and learning a foreign
            language. Suddenly, coding seemed so completely doable! I enrolled
            in an online bootcamp with CareerFoundry and the rest is history!
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a natural analytical ability to make things that are
            difficult to understand understood, whether it is verbally, on
            paper, or through an application. That served me well as a high
            school teacher and serves me well now as a programmer. I enjoy
            making technology more accessible and understandable for everyone.
          </p>
