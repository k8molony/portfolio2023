                  I've always had an interest in technology but never thought I
                  could actually code until I suddenly found myself teaching
                  online. I was a High School French teacher, and due to the
                  global pandemic, I suddenly had to figure out the best way to
                  keep my students interested through a screen. Our district
                  used the Learning Management System (LMS) Canvas, which has a
                  lot of simple things to do, but to make it even better, it
                  allows you to go into the code. I started playing with that,
                  learning some simple HTML, and realized that there were a lot
                  of similarities between learning that and learning a foreign
                  language. Suddenly, coding seemed so completely doable! I
                  enrolled in an online bootcamp with CareerFoundry and the rest
                  is history!
                </p>

                  I have a natural analytical ability to make things that are
                  difficult to understand understood, whether it is verbally, on
                  paper, or through an application. That served me well as a
                  high school teacher and serves me well now as a programmer. I
                  enjoy making technology more accessible and understandable for
                  everyone.

    </Container>
  );
}

export default Welcome;
