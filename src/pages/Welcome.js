              I've always had an interest in technology but never thought I
              could actually code until I suddenly found myself teaching online.
              I was a French teacher, and due to the global pandemic, I suddenly
              had to figure out the best way to keep my students interested
              through a screen. Our district used the LMS Canvas, which has a
              lot of simple things to do, but to make it even better, it allows
              you to go into the code. I started playing with that, learning
              some simple HTML, and realized that there were a lot of
              similarities between learning that and learning a foreign
              language. Suddenly, coding seemed so completely doable! I enrolled
              in an online bootcamp with CareerFoundry and the rest is history!

              I have a natural analytical ability to make things that are
              difficult to understand understood, whether it is verbally, on
              paper, or through an application. That served me well as a high
              school teacher and serves me well now as a programmer. I enjoy
              making technology more accessible and understandable for everyone.
